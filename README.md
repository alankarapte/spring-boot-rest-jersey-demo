ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alankarapte

# this project demonstrate rest web services using Jersey (JAX-RS)

# Dependancies used:

* Spring data JPA
* DevTool
* Jersey
* H2 database (for console- http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
* lombok

# Package name guide:

### resource package:
* this is resource package,
* it is equal to controller package in spring rest 
* but in JAX-RS good practice is to name it as resource

### dao package:
* contain data access layer
* it is equal to repository package in spring rest 

### model package:
* contain domain classess


# Point to be noted

* I have used @PostConstruct which is one of the way to running logic on startup, we are using H2 DB (in memory) so I ran the logic to insert some records into H2 DB.

* I have not used any spring MVC component here so there is no DiscpatcherServlet, so someone need to scan resources e.g. EmployeeResource. I need to add some scanner who will scan for resource classes which I added in config package by class as 'public class RestConfig extends org.glassfish.jersey.server.ResourceConfig'. I used constructor from supreclass in it to register resource classes e.g. EmployeeResource class

* I have not annotate DAO layer i.e. repository with @Repository annotation

* I have used @Path which equals to @RequestMapping in spring rest

* I have not used service layer just for simplicity

* @POST, @PUT, @DELETE, @Consumes, @Produces, @PathParam

# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The original package name 'com.alankar.spring-boot-rest-jersey-demo' is invalid and this project uses 'com.alankar.springbootrestjerseydemo' instead.
